# Project Ideas

- MoA, Protein Folding, Nuclei Detection 🧬
- Comparison of Portfolio Optimization Algorithms, Automated Markets, Implied Volatility 💸
- Parametric Urban Design 🏢
- Distributed Algorithms for Mitigation of Congestion in Large Cities 🙈
- Reinforcement Learning or Algorithms for Games 🎮

There's an additional idea realted to generating biomedical images for better models and variable data but who knows.
