# Problem Statement

Many of the decisions made in early stages of design are highly impactful to the building's enviornmental preformance [1] however the impact of these decisions are usually not known until later stages of design after other decisions are made, therefore we use machine learning and parametric design in order to help us better analyse the uncertianty inherit in these early design decisions to help architect more sustainable buildings.

# Scope

The project plans on creating a piece of software, model, or plugin in order to help architects / building designers better understand and estimate the enviornmental impact of early design decisions.

## How

The basic idea comes from two papers [1] and [2] where the authors attempt to use machine learning methods to analyse the uncertianty related design decisions and enviornmental impact. Essentially what we are trying to do is take a set of design parameters and correlate those with a large dataset of outcomes
