						<h2>Project Overview</h2>

					<section>
						<h2>What is Parametric Desgin?</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						Parametric design is a process based on algorithmic thinking
						that enables the expression of parameters and rules that, together,
						define, encode and clarify the relationship between design intent
						and design response.

						<h2>Goal</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						The goal of this project is to, use machine learning and parametric design
						techniques in order to produce more sustainable living, ie. minimizing some
						loss function in order to reduce enviornmental impact.

						<h3>
							Assessing environmental performance in early building design stage:
							An integrated parametric design and machine learning method
						</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Essentially: we want to correlate early design parameters to later enviornmental
						outcomes using machine learning techniques. 
						Usually we wait later to see the outcomes of the building but usually by the time this has
						happened early design parameters have already made a huge impact on outcomes and
						are very difficult to change.
