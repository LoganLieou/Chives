## Professor Meeting?

Thoughts on the professor meeting, sadness painful or do we feel like it went fine I may show up to moderate professor has notoriously hard time with technology?

## Updates?

How is progress? Some models the professor told you guys to look into: XGBoost, FoldR++, MLP, Using DL???

## Scoping

Start off with replicating the paper, I belive that there's something in here on generating these datasets, there's also some additional things that we can do i.e. comparision of some different models than the ones used in the paper etc. probably need to read more hmm....

## The Parametric Design Part

I will look into this keep working on whatever you're working on atm
