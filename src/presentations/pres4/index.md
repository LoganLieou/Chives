## Regression Task

Why are we doing the regression task when it's probably not a very good approach?

## Regression Task

Why are we doing the regression task when it's probably not a very good approach?

- Niave model $\rightarrow{}$ more advanced model

## Let's First Start with the "Machine Learning" Part

So I realized I was supposed to probably teach more.

## Process for Data Science / Machine Learning

I sort of covered this already, get data $\rightarrow{}$ eda $\rightarrow{}$ feature engineering $\rightarrow{}$ model training / testing $\rightarrow{}$ model optimization and evaluation $\rightarrow{}$ repeat.

When doing the regression task we want to do this approach with very little overhead a sort of niave approach where we can go back and tune more advanced models later but what we want right now is simly a minimum viable product which we can begin to build on.

## For Me

What do they need help with?

## The Dataset

I want you guys to start looking at the dataset perhaps depending on how we did with regression I think it's important to sort of understand this process before we get started.
