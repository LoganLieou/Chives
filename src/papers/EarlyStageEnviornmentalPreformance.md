# Early Stage Environmental Performance

## 1. Introduction (THIS NEEDS TO BE EDITED)
The life cycle enviornmental performance is best handled by making optimal early design decisions, many parameters with significant enviornmental impact are decided early on in the desigin of a building. However traditional design is an evolutionary process meaning that things change over time, yes yes, therefore we don't actually have enough information early on for traditional approaches a full enviornmental performance assessment. These more traditional methods include: BPS, and LCA. Uncertianty of detailed design information makes it difficult to make accurate predictions early in the design of a building. Deterministic anlysis of with default settings cannot provide the ranges of uncertianties and risks associated with early desicisions, possible permutations of uncertian parameters can be explored using monte carlo analysis, in order to quantify performance uncertianty reasonable probability distrobutions of unspecified parameters which are usually not avalible are needed when sampling this approaches

Parametric design technology is used to generate reasonable design datasets, that enable the ML algorithm to learn relationships between early parameters and uncertianty of enviornmental impact.

## 2. Background
### 2.1 Design Stages
Conceptial, Schematic, and Detailed design are three building design phases, that are done in an evolutionary fasion meaning that one is done after the other. Descisions made early on in design significantly effect a buildings enviornmental performance and are also very difficult and costly to change later on, due to the fact that many later stage decisions will be made based on earlier parameters. causing early parameters to have significant impact on enviornmental performance.
