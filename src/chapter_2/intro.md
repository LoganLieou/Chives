# Project Statement

Scuffed: a project about Urban Design, Urban Planning, Parametric Design, and Machine Learning (maybe).

# Timeline

In the first few weeks of the project participants will learn the basics of parametric design as well as urban design patterns and principles, next they will learn some discrete math, data structures and algorithms as well as basic ML models and hyper parameter tuning methods. Next they will attempt to implement an algorithm or aproach that will be really :poggers:

In weeks 8-10 the team needs to focus a lot of their effort on making the presentation and the poster for the symposium so most of the actual work and deliverable need to be done at this point.

# Prerequesites

Knowlege on parametric desgin, machine learning, algorithms and datastructures, inferential statistics.
