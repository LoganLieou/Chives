# Contingincy Plan

Decision tree, where we have different outcomes based on where the team is in the project.

## What if my Team is Behind?

If my team is behind the scope of the project will most likely need to be, scaled back, we need to slow down and cover concepts more thuroughly with the team, in the case that the team is behind the lead needs to step in and do more for the project.

### Week 1:
The only way that you get behind in week 1 is if you don't show up. The plan here is: email the participant who doesn't show up with warning + information on logistics from week 1 + homework that was, assigned.

### Week 2:
If team gets behind this week, ie. was unable to read the research papers / didn't understand the research papers, this is sort of expected and totally fine, if this is the case I will direct to the documentation on my site summirizing my interpretations of research papers, if there are questions concerning particular concepts that are difficult it is then my job to teach those concepts to participants.

### Week 3:
If they are unable to solve the homework problem assigned on week 2 ( this is some sort of applicable problem ie. leetcode or kaggle smth ) if they are unable to solve this problem, then we can stack trace on their brain and find out where it went wrong, do some whiteboarding as well as covering basic things such as **installing python** or something if that's where they got stuck.

### Week 4-5:
On a week by week basis I go over their code and progress toward completing the MVP of the project. Falling behind in this phase of the project looks like if they are having issues with understanding how to implement code, having issues with tooling (they don't know how to use pip) something of this sort I can help them get back on track toward the MVP, by covering concepts and allowing them to think out process in psuedo code or giving them lessons on tooling.

### Week 6-8:
This is where the project temporarily diverges according to the time line, depending on how the team feels. If the team is behind we will drop to plan A, if team is feeling good then we can go with plan B. At any point if a team on track for B feels that they cannot continue with this track, that a feature will not be, completed or something like this we will drop down to track A, most likely teams will start out on track B then drop down to track B. It is up to my discreation if team should drop to track A or stay on track B.

### Week 9:
So yeah the poster and presentation, I mean at this point the only way to get behind is not finishing the poster on time unfortunately this happened last semester, I will be sure to do as much as I can to make sure that this doesn't happen but this may require a little bit of crunch from team unfortunately if they fall behind. But hopefully they won't have to do that and that's what A, B tracks are, designed to prevent.

### Week 10:
If team is behind in creating the presentation. **empisis on process documentation early on in project to prevent this** if team is unable to produce presentation in time then they will have to present what they have, worst case they have to crunch :((

## What if my Team is Ahead?

If the team is ahead that's great we can build more and more features onto the MVP creating a more and more impressive project, the only thing here to watch out for is if the team is getting too overzealous with what they think they can acheive, allow them to attempt but don't expect anything, warn them about creep etc. but when it comes time for the poster, team just needs to use what they have instead of continuing to pursue additional features on the project.

## AFK Members

4 Strike policy:
- Warning
- Probation mode: individally check up on member
- Ask if they would like to continue + continue individally making sure member is not afk
- Ejection

## Distributing the Work

Some members are going to be better at different things naturally, make sure work is, distributed based on what each member can have the most impact doing, even though it's really up to the team to distrubute work, be upfront about what we belive each member should be doing based on their abilities.

Example: Some members have stronger conceptual skills compared to their technical skills (writing code) thus should focus on project docuemtnation directing and communicating concepts with other members who can implement this into code.
