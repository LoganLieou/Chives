# Project Statement

The title of the project is "Machine Learning and Parametric Design for Sustainable Living". What does this actually mean? Parametric design is a paradigm used by architects, designers and planners in order to more effectively connect the ideas of what they are changing in the design with the goals of the project. In this project participants will use both machine learning and parametric design patterns in order to come up with solutions for issues faced in early design phases when forecasting environmental impact early on in design phases, in order to allow for more sustainably designed living.

# Timeline

### Week 1: 

Participants will be, introduced to the project and problem definition 

**Learn:** Logistics for ACM Research, how does this thing work?

**Assign:** (Research and Literature Review for HW)

**Deliverable:** *Nothing* 


### Week 2:

This week we want to cover what they read in the research papers from week one as well as go over anything that was confusing from those papers. 

**Learn:** The general architecture of the project, everyone from reading the papers at this point should sort of understand the scope as well as the approaches that we're going for.

**Assign:** Applicable problem (some sort of algorithmic thinking problem, kaggle comp, or lc problem etc.) 

**Deliverable:** Go over what they read last week discuss approaches to the problem.


### Week 3:

Go over applicable problem that they were, assigned and see if there were any issues solving this problem. Additionally this week we want to sort of understand the tooling related to what we're doing.

**Learn:** Basic tooling for the project. (git, python, pip, eda)

**Assign:** Start work on the project you are free go attempt this research project.

**Deliverable:** Applicable problem from last week.


### Week 4-5:

Work on the core of the project

**Learn:** From our mistakes.

**Assign:** Work on the project lol.

**Deliverable:** Each week need update and code review on where team is at in the process.


### Week 6:

Participants should have the MVP completed at least at this point, discuss moving forward with the project, do we want to stack on features or do we want to focus on refining what we have and presentation?

**Learn:** Where we want to go with the project.

**Assign A:** A path refers to if the participants want to focus on presentation. In this case at week 6 I will assign them to "refine" the project such that it's in a presentable state.

**Assign B:** B path refers to if the participants want to continue building. A particular feature will be, assigned and decided on.

**Deliverable:** Project MVP


### Week 7:
At this point we should see the project almost complete, the features we want to add on need to be almost completed. In the case of path A, I want to see that the participants have refined the project to a level that is presentable.

**Assign A:** Document the project, what is the thought process throughout the entire project, explainable ideas from the project, what were you able to learn form this experience etc, fully understanding the concepts you are presenting is important. Additionally start work on the poster cause that's due soon.

**Assign B:** Refine feature, or add on additional feature, if they want to add an additional feature, the feature needs to be explainable as well as being able to be, completed within a week.

**Deliverable A:** Project, needs to be semi done or essentially done (MVP), I want to see the loose end and scuffness being, ironed out at this point.

**Deliverable B:** The feature being, done or looking like it's going to be, completed in time.


### Week 8:
At this point project needs to be coming to a close, path B needs to refine the project and tie up loose ends in the project as well as iron out the scuff.

**Assign A:** Start on the presentation and continue work on the poster.

**Assign B:** Clean up the project as well as assign the poster.

**Deliverable A:** Progress on the poster.

**Deliverable B:** Project refinement, less scuffed version of project that is presentable, with new added and cool features.


### Week 9:
Team needs to work on the presentation, because SyMpOsIuM. This is where the two paths converge again, as path A should be working on a really good poster and path B should be putting together the poster after finishing adding the features to the project.

**Assign:** Presentation 

**Deliverable:** Poster


### Week 10:
Yeah presentation needs to be, done or at least almost complete, I want participants to present to me so that I can help them with presentation (potentially).

**Deliverable:** Presentation present to me or something like that unsure at this point
