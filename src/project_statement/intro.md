# Project Statement

The title of the project is "Machine Learning and Parametric Design for Sustainable Living". What does this actually mean? Parametric design is a paradigm used by architects, designers and planners in order to more effectively connect the ideas of what they are changing in the design with the goals of the project. In this project participants will use both machine learning and parametric design patterns in order to come up with solutions for issues faced in early design phases when forecasting environmental impact early on in design phases, in order to allow for more sustainably designed living.

# Timeline

### Week 1: 

Participants will be introduced to the project and problem definition 

**Learn:** Participants need to learn about different regression models, basic parametric design patterns and objectives, additionally they will begin to think about how they want to approach this problem.

**Assign:** (Research and Literature Review for HW)

**Deliverable:** *Nothing* 


### Week 2:

Introduction to tooling, and methods. 

**Learn:** Tooling (sklearn, pandas, xgboost) 

**Assign:** Find more datasets, applicable problem (some sort of algorithmic thinking problem, kaggle comp, or lc problem :kekw:) 

**Deliverable:** Go over what they read last week discuss approaches to the problem.

### Week 3:

Discover new datasets, and work on MVP

**Assign:** Find more data, better data sets, do we have to build our own?

**Deliverable:** I want to see code completed to a certian extent what do they have so far, each week I want to sort of review what thay're doing.

### Week 4-5:

MVP Should be completed maybe start building on this?

### Week 6-7:

This week participants need to essentially have the project completed at least the MVP targeted a the begining of the project. (there's actually no way this doesn't happen). And potentially build on the MVP. Additionally work needs to begin on the poster and presentation this week for the symposium. 

**Assign:** Poster and Presentation 

**Deliverable:** The entire project


### Week 9:

**Assign:** Presentation 

**Deliverable:** Poster


### Week 10:

**Deliverable:** Presentation present to me or something like that unsure at this point
