# Minimum Viable Product

*What should the participants be able to produce at least?*
The minimum viable product for this project will be, a solution that simply correlates features from a dataset to labels in the same dataset that target / indicate environmental impact in some why, this can be done very simply with a regressor model, we will avoid AI as much as possible but if we want the 3 line solution you can always just use fastai tabulation, along with some sort of environmental impact dataset.

## Steps to completing this product

1. Find the dataset, that targets the specific indicator that we’re looking for
2. Clean the dataset
3. Train test split, then train the model that we want to use SVR, XGBR, AI approaches
4. Verify results on some set of features

After these steps have been completed, participants will then build on the product, or not if this is all that is completed.

## Building on the MVP

Using the MVP participants can start to explore designs for sustainable living in a parametric architecture workbench (FreeCAD or smth) potentially develop a plugin for this software, or create some sort of real world application that assists designers when developing models.

**\*Note:** in Free CAD usually you store parameters in a spreadsheet, these parameters can be fed into the model, tbh I don’t know that much about parametric design. Maybe other parametric software is similar like this.

## Alternitive Products / Build Paths

* If the team wants to explore AI/DL then you can also compare performance between ML approaches and AI/DL approaches.
